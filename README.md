I completed this project in Google Cloud's BigQuery analytics platform. This project, challenged by Juan Martinez, was an exploratory analysis of the data set "Iowa Liquor Sales".
The following questions were proposed to be answered:

--What are the trends in Iowa's alcohol sales over the years included in this dataset?

--Are there any seasonal patterns in the liquor sales?

--Which counties have the highest liquor sales?

--Which liquor brands have the highest profit margins for retailers?

This project included the folliowing SQL functions and clauses: DENSE_RANK, OVER, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, EXTRACT, ROUND, AVG
